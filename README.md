Oh man, just got out of the   Deva and I’m still tripping over what just happened. Seriously, my brain feels like it got tangled in a ball of yarn those scenes just keep looping around like a never-ending roundabout. You imagine a circus but with people who totally forgot they’re supposed to be human. Where do I even start? The ending, maybe? It’s like accidentally swallowing a spoonful of wasabi – surprise!

Okay, that opening sequence, right? My back was killing me because the seats were practically shaped like medieval torture devices, but I barely noticed because the screen? It was drowning us in colors and sounds like an exploding rainbow. And the guy with the hat, what was his deal? He kept showing up everywhere, like a dandelion in a 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed sidewalk. Anyway, someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but how do you squeeze all that onto a screen? It’s like cramming a tornado into a shoebox.

> There was that one scene – I was fumbling with half-stale popcorn, buttery fingers and all – where she just looked at the camera. And it was like she was staring right through the layers of manufactured fluff in my brain. Emotion hitting like a freight truck but soft like marshmallows? Makes no sense, but there it is.

Then there’s this part where the characters are running through some field, and I swear, it felt like the Dolby speakers were turned up to a level where I could feel every blade of grass rub against my soul. The director has this thing for chaos, like a kid mixing all the paint colors into a murky brown swirl. And speaking of swirls, did I tell you about this wizard guy—no cape, just mismatched socks. Magic shouldn’t be that relatable.

Somewhere between munching on popcorn crumbs and shifting because my backside went numb, it hit me, the dialogues. Oh god, trying to catch up with them was like chasing after a dozen stray cats high on caffeine. It was impossible, yet I couldn't look away. Whoever wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , be ready to hop on a coaster that rides through a Salvador Dali painting.

The transitions were jagged, like a jigsaw puzzle piece that doesn’t quite fit but you shove it in anyway. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it was sort of like being underwater, holding your breath, but also, somehow, dancing? Yeah, I dunno, but I’m so glad I went, even if I’m leaving with more question marks than I arrived with.

Here’s a random bit of code, probably pasted here by my inner chaos demon:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  float deva = 3.14;
  printf(Lost in code like the  .%f
, deva);
}
```

And there it is. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it if you dare, just don’t forget to breathe.
